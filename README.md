# RAMQ File Converter
Software that I built for a dentist cabinet that allows them submit their billing transactions and data in the mandatory XML format required by to the [RAMQ (Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec)](https://www.ramq.gouv.qc.ca/en). The converter was programmed using the [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) programming language.
